# pokemon-cli

(WIP)
A command line tool built using Node.js and TypeScript that shows pokemon info by consuming the pokemon API (found at https://pokeapi.co/v2)

## Setup

1. Clone this repo:
```
$ npm install --global pokemon-cli
```
2. Inside the directory, run `npm i` to install dependencies
3. Run the CLI with
```
node dist/index.js
```
4. Optionally install the package globally with `npm i -g` to run it anywhere with `pokemon`
